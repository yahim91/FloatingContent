@inproceedings { omnetpp,
	abstract = {The OMNeT++ discrete event simulation environment has been
publicly available since 1997. It has been created with the
simulation of communication networks, multiprocessors and other
distributed systems in mind as application area, but instead of
building a specialized simulator, OMNeT++ was designed to be as
general as possible. Since then, the idea has proven to work, and
OMNeT++ has been used in numerous domains from queuing
network simulations to wireless and ad-hoc network simulations,
from business process simulation to peer-to-peer network, optical
switch and storage area network simulations. This paper presents
an overview of the OMNeT++ framework, recent challenges
brought about by the growing amount and complexity of third
party simulation models, and the solutions we introduce in the
next major revision of the simulation framework.},
